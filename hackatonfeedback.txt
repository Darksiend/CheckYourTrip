Hello Anton This is your Hackaton feedback.

I really liked your project. Is using very well API fetch infromation creating a lot of features realted with a city.
You are also using very well DOM manipulation, form handling and events. Also liked the styling of your page and the fact
that it was responsive to. I was only able to retrieve one city information i guess because of the api being free.
Well done implementing all the knowledge acquired in the course. 
You can add a button that let the user go back to the home page and pick a different city.


Congratulations on your project you did a very good job.
